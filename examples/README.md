# P4 Code Samples

## Introduction

This directory includes P4 code samples, meant to be run on bmv2, which
illustrates several more advanced features of P4. The following samples are
included:

- `copy_to_cpu`: how to use the `clone_ingress_to_egress primitive` to clone the
  packet, encapsulate it and send it to a special port.
- `meter`: how to use indirect meters in P4.
- `TLV_parsing`: how to parse IPv4 options
- `register`: how to use registers in P4 and read / write the state from the
  control plane
- `counter`: how to use counters in P4
- `action_profile`: how to use action profiles in P4, using ECMP as support
- `resubmit`: how to resubmit packets to the ingress pipelines
- `simple_nat`: a basic implementation of a full-cone NAT for TCP traffic

All examples are orgranized the same way, with a `p4src` directory containing
the P4 source code, and a `README` file describing the P4 program and explaining
how to run a quick demonstration.

## Obtaining required software

To complete the exercises, you will need to clone 2 p4lang Github repositories
and install their dependencies. To clone the repositories:

- `git clone https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model.git bmv2`
- `git clone https://github.com/p4lang/p4c-bm.git p4c-bmv2`

The first repository ([bmv2](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model)) is the
second version of the behavioral model. It is a C++ software switch that will
behave according to your P4 program. The second repository
([p4c-bmv2](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c-bm)) is the compiler for the
behavioral model: it takes P4 program and output a JSON file which can be loaded
by the behavioral model.

Each of these repositories come with dependencies. `p4c-bmv2` is a Python
repository and installing the required Python dependencies is very easy to do
using `pip`: `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`.

`bmv2` is a C++ repository and has more external dependencies. They are listed
in the
[README](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/blob/master/README.md). If
you are running Ubuntu 14.04+, the dependencies should be easy to install (you
can use the `install_deps.sh` script that comes with `bmv2`). Do not forget to
build the code once all the dependencies have been installed:

- `./autogen.sh`
- `./configure`
- `make`

## Before starting the exercises

You need to tell us where you cloned the `bmv2` and `p4c-bm` repositories
:). Please update the values of the shell variables `BMV2_PATH` and
`P4C_BM_PATH` in the `env.sh` file - located in the root directory of this
repository. Note that if you cloned both repositories in the same directory as
this one (`tutorials`), you will not need to change the value of the variables.

You will also need to run the `veth_setup.sh` script included in this directory
as `sudo` to setup the veth interfaces needed by the switch.

That's all :)
