# p4 tutorials learn

This repo is borrowed from https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials.

What I do is to finish p4 programs in `P4D2_2018_East` folder.

## Env setup

Before starting running exercises, make sure you have finished env setup. You
can find detailed instructions in `env_config.sh` file, which could help you
configure a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 VM to run those p4 tutorial programs.
